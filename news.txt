Texton just got a news app!
____________
16.3.2024 TEXTON 0.5.1

a few bug fixes have been
made!
____________
18.5.2024 TEXTON 0.5.2

what's new?

- new app launching method
due to issues with the previous
method of running files within
TEXTON, I changed it.
this means most old apps are not
compatible with the new version,
but alot more is possible!

- new module requirements
you will now need to get
inputimeout
to run texton and the 
apps it offers flawlessly.
why?
because this allows 
for more unique games!

- SEND!
to celebrate and demonstrate 
the use of this module you 
need now, I made a game
to show an example of use!

Available in the appstore now!

- other
There have been ground 
breaking changes in the core 
functionality of texton!

You will barely notice 
a difference if you are the
typical all day user, but 
developers will be very happy 
about this.

But don't worry, even the 
regular user will venefit
from this,as more and better 
apps will come around!

- the future

features I plan to add:

- sound capabillity 
(it has been hard)
- notification bar
- image viewer
- alphabetical file sorting
